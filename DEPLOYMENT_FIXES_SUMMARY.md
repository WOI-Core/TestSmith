# Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CORS Errors
**Root Cause**: The production IP address (34.143.158.179) was not included in the backend's allowed CORS origins list.
**Fix**: Added production IP to the allowed origins in `packages/backend/index.js`:
```javascript
'http://34.143.158.179',
'https://34.143.158.179',
```

### 2. API 404 Errors / Broken API Requests
**Root Cause**: NGINX was not configured to proxy `/api` requests to the backend running on port 3001. All API requests were being sent to the frontend on port 3000.
**Fix**: Created proper NGINX configuration with API routing:
```nginx
location /api {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3001;
    # ... proxy headers
}
```

### 3. Missing Favicon (404 Error)
**Root Cause**: No favicon.ico file existed in the frontend public directory.
**Fix**: Created a basic favicon.ico file in `packages/frontend/public/`

### 4. PM2 Not Starting on Boot
**Root Cause**: PM2 startup script was not configured.
**Fix**: Configured PM2 to start on system boot:
```bash
pm2 save
pm2 startup
# Then ran the generated command with sudo
```

## Current Production Setup

### Server Configuration
- **Frontend**: Next.js running on port 3000 (managed by PM2)
- **Backend**: Express.js running on port 3001 (managed by PM2)
- **Reverse Proxy**: NGINX on port 80
- **Process Manager**: PM2 with auto-restart and boot startup

### Environment Variables
- Frontend: Using `.env.local` with Supabase configuration
- Backend: Using `.env` with Supabase and frontend URL configuration

### NGINX Configuration
- Main site (`/`) → Frontend (port 3000)
- API routes (`/api`) → Backend (port 3001)
- Additional services:
  - `/api/toolsmith` → Port 8000
  - `/v1/query` → Port 8001

## Production Checklist

### ✅ Server Health
- [x] PM2 processes running without errors
- [x] NGINX configuration valid and reloaded
- [x] Both frontend and backend accessible

### ✅ API Functionality
- [x] API endpoints accessible from browser
- [x] CORS headers properly configured
- [x] Authentication endpoints working (returning appropriate errors)

### ✅ Frontend
- [x] Site loads successfully at http://34.143.158.179
- [x] No console errors for missing resources
- [x] API calls from frontend work correctly

### ✅ Security & Configuration
- [x] Environment variables properly set
- [x] CORS configured for production IP
- [x] Security headers in place (Helmet.js)

### ✅ Reliability
- [x] PM2 configured for auto-restart on crash
- [x] PM2 configured to start on system boot
- [x] Error logging configured for debugging

## Testing Results

1. **Frontend Access**: ✅ Returns 200 OK with Next.js headers
2. **API Access**: ✅ Returns 200 OK with proper CORS headers
3. **Problems Endpoint**: ✅ Returns 6 problems
4. **Auth Endpoint**: ✅ Returns 401 for invalid credentials (expected behavior)
5. **CORS**: ✅ Access-Control-Allow-Origin header present

## Next Steps for Full SSL/HTTPS Setup (Optional)

1. Install Certbot:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   ```

2. Obtain SSL certificate:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
   ```

3. Update environment variables to use HTTPS URLs

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs

# Check NGINX status
sudo systemctl status nginx

# Test API
curl http://34.143.158.179/api/problems

# Restart services if needed
pm2 restart all
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Final Status
✅ **The entire site and API are live, accessible, and functioning correctly with no runtime errors.**
