The main function reads input, processes each element by updating and querying the Fenwick Tree, and computes an answer modulo 1e9+7.\n\nFirst, the problem involves using a Fenwick Tree for efficient prefix sum queries and updates. The Fenwick Tree is used here to count the number of elements less than or equal to a certain value as they are processed. This suggests that the problem might be related to counting inversions or similar problems where order matters.\n\nLooking at the tags provided, \"prefix-sum\" is one, but the Fenwick Tree is a data structure used for efficient prefix sum calculations. However, the tag list includes \"prefix-sum\" but not a specific tag for Fenwick Tree. The closest might be \"prefix-sum\", but the problem's approach uses a data structure (Fenwick Tree) which is part of the \"binary-indexed-tree\" or \"segment-tree\" tags. Wait, but in the provided tag list, there's a \"segment-tree\" but not \"binary-indexed-tree\". Hmm, but the user said to only use the provided tags. So maybe \"prefix-sum\" is the main one here, but the code is using a Fenwick Tree which is a data structure for prefix sums. However, the problem's algorithm might be related to counting something, maybe inversion count which is a common problem using Fenwick Trees. \n\nWait, the code is processing elements and for each element, it's querying the sum up to (1e6 - a +1) and then updating the position. That seems like it's counting how many elements are smaller than the current element as they are added, which is typical for inversion count. So the problem could be related to \"inversion-count\", but \"inversion-count\" isn't in the tag list. The available tags include \"combinatorics\", \"sorting\", etc. But the main data structure here is the Fenwick Tree, which isn't directly listed. However, the Fenwick Tree is a type of \"prefix-sum\" structure. So maybe the tags should include \"prefix-sum\" and \"combinatorics\" if it's about counting inversions. Alternatively, \"combinatorics\" might be relevant here since inversion counts are combinatorial. Also, the problem uses modulo operations, so maybe \"math\" is involved. \n\nLooking at the provided tags, \"prefix-sum\" and \"combinatorics\" could be appropriate. Also, since the code uses a Fenwick Tree, which is a data structure, but there's no specific tag for it, perhaps \"prefix-sum\" is the closest. The problem's approach is efficient, using a data structure for prefix sums, so \"prefix-sum\" is a must. Also, the problem might involve \"sorting\" if the elements are being processed in a certain order, but the code doesn't sort them. Instead, it's using the Fenwick Tree to count as elements are added. \n\nAnother aspect is the use of the Fenwick Tree for an efficient solution, which might imply that a brute-force approach would be too slow. However, the code itself doesn't use brute-force, so that tag might not apply. The problem's main algorithm is using a Fenwick Tree for prefix sum queries and updates, which is part of the \"prefix-sum\" tag. Additionally, since the problem is about counting elements in a certain way, \"combinatorics\" might be relevant. \n\nSo the possible tags are \"prefix-sum\" and \"combinatorics\". Let me check the provided tag list again. Yes, \"prefix-sum\" and \"combinatorics\" are present. Also, \"math\" is there because of the modulo operation. But the main algorithm is based on the Fenwick Tree for prefix sums. However, the \"prefix-sum\" tag is already there. So the correct tags would be \"prefix-sum\" and \"combinatorics\". Wait, but maybe \"math\" is also needed? The modulo is part of the problem's output, but the core algorithm isn't math-heavy beyond that. So maybe just \"prefix-sum\" and \"combinatorics\". Alternatively, \"combinatorics\" might not be necessary if it's more about data structures. But the problem's logic is about counting the number of elements processed so far that are less than the current element, which is a combinatorial problem (like inversion count). \n\nTherefore, the tags should be \"prefix-sum\" and \"combinatorics\".\n</think>\n\nprefix-sum, combinatorics",

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe code starts by including the standard library headers and defining some constants. The main variables are a 2D array A, a visited array, and a count variable cnt. The directions di and dj suggest movement in four directions (up, down, left, right), which is typical for BFS or DFS in grid problems.\n\nIn the main function, they read the grid dimensions n and m, then fill the grid. Then there's a loop over each cell. If the cell is 0 or already visited, they skip it. Otherwise, they perform a BFS using a queue. The BFS explores adjacent cells. If the adjacent cell is out of bounds or visited, they skip. If the cell value is 0, they increment cnt. Otherwise, they add it to the queue and mark as visited.\n\nThe goal here seems to be counting the number of 0 cells that are adjacent to regions of 1s. Wait, no. Let me think again. The code is grouping connected 1s (since they are added to the queue if A[ik][jk] is 1?), but when they encounter a 0 cell adjacent to the current 1s, they increment cnt. So maybe it's counting the number of 0s that are surrounding the connected regions of 1s. Or perhaps it's counting the number of 0s adjacent to the 1s during BFS traversal.\n\nWait, let me look again. The BFS starts from cells where A[i][j] is non-zero (since the initial check is if A[i][j] is 0 or visited, continue. So the starting cell must be 1. Then, during BFS, when they check adjacent cells: if the adjacent cell is 0, they increment cnt. If it's 1 and not visited, they add it to the queue. So this code is, for each connected component of 1s, finding all adjacent 0s and counting them. But maybe the problem is to count the number of 0s that are on the perimeter of each 1s group. For example, like the number of islands' surrounding water cells, but the exact problem isn't given. However, the code's logic is to traverse each connected component of 1s using BFS, and for each adjacent cell that is 0, increment cnt. So the code is counting the number of 0 cells adjacent to any 1 in the connected components. \n\nSo the main algorithm here is BFS for traversing connected components in a grid. The data structures involved are queues. The problem likely involves grid traversal, connected components, and counting certain cells. \n\nLooking at the provided tags, the relevant ones would be BFS, graph (since grid is a graph), and maybe simulation or implementation.

Also, 'implementation' might be relevant because the code is handling the BFS with specific conditions. But the problem's primary algorithm is BFS.

The solve function is recursive and tries different digits for each position, checking if they meet the conditions.

So permutation is another tag. But wait, the provided tag list doesn't have 'permutation', but there's 'backtracking' which is related.

So 'brute-force' might also be a relevant tag. But backtracking is more specific here since it's generating possibilities recursively with pruning.\n\nThe problem also involves checking conditions similar to the game Mastermind, where you have to match the number of correct positions and correct digits in wrong positions. This is a form of constraint satisfaction, which is common in backtracking problems. \n\nLooking at the code's main logic, it's using a recursive backtracking approach to generate all possible digit arrangements and then validating each against the given conditions. The validation part is O(m*n^2) in time, which might be acceptable for small n (since n is up to 10, as per the array size). \n\nSo the main tags here are backtracking and brute-force. But since backtracking is a more specific technique for generating possibilities, maybe backtracking is the primary tag. Also, the problem might involve some combinatorial aspects, but combinatorics is a broader term. \n\nWait, the problem requires generating all permutations of digits (without repetition), which is a combinatorial problem. So 'combinatorics' could be another tag. But the code uses backtracking to generate these permutations, which is a common approach for combinatorial problems. \n\nSo the tags would be backtracking and combinatorics.

But since the code is generating all permutations via backtracking, which is a combinatorial approach, I think the main tags are backtracking and combinatorics. \n\nWait, the code uses a visited array to track which digits have been used, which is a common technique in permutation generation. So permutation is part of the problem, but since the tag list doesn't have 'permutation', but includes 'backtracking' and 'combinatorics', those are the ones to use. \n\nSo the final tags would be backtracking and combinatorics. Let me check if there's any other aspect. The problem also involves checking the conditions, which might be part of the problem's logic but doesn't add another tag.

Let me read through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the code includes some standard headers and uses a vector for adjacency lists. The variables adj and color are declared, which suggests that this is a graph problem. The main function reads n and e, which are the number of nodes and edges, respectively. Then it builds an adjacency list for an undirected graph since each edge adds both directions.\n\nThe main loop starts with k from 1 to n, but inside that, there's a loop over all nodes i from 1 to n. For each node's adjacent nodes, it checks if the color of the child is the same as the current node. If so, it increments the child's color. The maximum color value is tracked, and finally, the output is mx + 1.\n\nHmm, this seems like a graph coloring problem. The goal might be to assign colors such that adjacent nodes don't have the same color. The algorithm here is trying to greedily assign colors. Each time, for every node, it checks its neighbors and increments their color if they conflict. The maximum color used plus one is the answer, which would be the minimum number of colors needed in some cases.\n\nBut wait, this approach doesn't look like the standard graph coloring algorithms. It's more of a greedy approach where colors are adjusted iteratively.

The code uses prefix sums, as I can see from the qs and qs_walk arrays which are built by accumulating values. The problem seems to involve handling queries efficiently, which is a common use case for prefix sums. The main logic is about calculating the sum of sandwiches and the endurance cost, which is stored in these prefix arrays.\n\nThen, for each query, they're using upper_bound on the qs_walk array. Upper_bound is part of binary search algorithms. So binary-search should be a tag here. The problem also involves processing multiple queries, which might relate to a search or sliding window approach, but looking at the code, the key part is the binary search here.\n\nThe problem's solution relies heavily on prefix sums for quick calculations and binary search to find the required index efficiently.

The code is written in C++ and seems to be solving a problem using dynamic programming. Let me look through the code step by step.\n\nFirst, the code includes standard headers and uses the 'll' type for long long integers. There's a DP table defined as a 2D array of structs. The main loop is structured with sizes and indices, which is typical for dynamic programming problems that involve ranges or sequences. \n\nThe key part here is the loop for 'sz' (size) starting from 1 up to n-1. For each size, it's considering chains of that length. The variables l and r represent the left and right indices of the chain. Then, for each possible split point m between l and r, it calculates the current cost by combining the left and right parts. \n\nThis structure reminds me of the Matrix Chain Multiplication problem, where you have to find the optimal way to parenthesize the multiplication of matrices to minimize the number of operations. In that problem, the DP approach uses a similar approach with chains and split points. \n\nIn the code, the DP state dp[i][j] stores the value (v) and the minimum sum (cost) for merging the elements from i to j. The transition involves trying all possible splits and choosing the one with the minimum cost. The value is updated as the sum of the left and right values modulo 100, and the cost is the sum of the individual costs plus the product of the values. \n\nSo the primary algorithm here is dynamic programming. The problem structure is similar to matrix chain multiplication, which is a classic DP problem. Therefore, the 'dynamic-programming' tag is definitely needed. \n\nLooking at the provided tag list, 'dynamic-programming' is present. The problem also involves arrays since the input is stored in an array and processed in a 2D DP table. The 'array' tag should be included. \n\nAdditionally, the problem's approach resembles the matrix chain multiplication technique, which is a specific application of dynamic programming. However, the provided tag list doesn't have a 'matrix-chain-multiplication' tag. The closest is 'dynamic-programming' and 'matrix', but the 'matrix' tag is more about matrix operations or structures, not the algorithm itself. Since the problem uses a 2D DP table but the core is dynamic programming, the 'matrix' tag might not be necessary here unless the problem specifically involves matrix operations. \n\nIn this case, the code isn't performing matrix multiplication; instead, it's using a 2D array for DP states. So the 'array' tag is more appropriate. \n\nOther possible tags: The problem might involve some arithmetic operations, but there's no indication of number theory or combinatorics beyond basic math. The 'math' tag is present, but the core is DP. So probably not needed unless the problem requires mathematical insights. \n\nThe code uses modulo 100, which is part of the problem's value calculation, but that's part of the DP state, not a separate tag. \n\nSo the main tags are 'dynamic-programming' and 'array'. The problem is similar to matrix chain multiplication, but since that's a specific DP application, and the provided tags don't have a specific one for that, the primary tags remain as DP and array. \n\nWait, the problem's code is structured similarly to the matrix chain multiplication DP approach. However, the provided tag list includes 'matrix', but that's for problems involving matrix operations. Since the code uses a 2D array for DP, which is an array of arrays, the 'array' tag is correct. \n\nSo the final tags are 'dynamic-programming' and 'array'. But wait, the code also uses a 2D DP table, which is a common structure in DP problems. The problem might also involve 'prefix-sum'? No, the code doesn't use prefix sums. The 'prefix-sum' tag is for problems that use prefix sums as part of the solution. \n\nNo, the code here is using a standard DP approach with splitting the problem into subproblems. So the correct tags are 'dynamic-programming' and 'array'. \n\nWait, looking back at the provided tag list, there's also 'segment-tree', but that's for specific data structures. The code here doesn't use any of those. \n\nSo the answer should be 'dynamic-programming, array'.\n</think>\n\ndynamic-programming, array",
